# Senior_Project_Testing
This project is aimed at targeting small business owners as a SaaS platform 
which automatically generates a semi-customized ecommerce website for their customer facing needs.
Small business owners often do not have the overhead to support an in-house IT team or contract a 
company to build and maintain an ecommerce website for them. This project looks to be an alternative and
cheaper solution in a day and age when more and more consumers are looking to make purchases online.
